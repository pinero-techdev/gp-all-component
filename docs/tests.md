# Testing

The project has available unit and end to end tests, those are integrated in the prepush hook, and ran every time before allowing anyone from pushing code with failing tests. 

## E2E
You can run the end to end tests with command `npm run e2e`, (you need to previously run the boilerplate project)  

## Unit test
You can run the unit tests with command `npm run test:lib`
